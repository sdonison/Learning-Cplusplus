# Overview

This is my first attempt using C++. The basic Hello World program prints Hello World on the screen, asks the user for their name, greets the user, and welcomes them to C++.
The second program, Area of Shapes, calculates the area of a rectangle, a triangle, or a circle, depending on the user's choice. The user provides the values required to calculate the selected shape and the program returns the answer to the user.
The final program, Note Saver, allows the user to save notes to a .txt file. Unfortunately, this program was lost when I uploaded the project to GitHub.

I wrote this software to teach myself how to code in C++. Prior to working on this project, I only knew how to code in Python. While the two languages are very similar, learning C++ was challenging. I may return to this in the future.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio 2022 as my IDE.

I used C++ as my programming language and I used the standard (std) library.
